This is an attempt to connect R, dplyr and BigQuery. The bigquery.R file currently does not work. 

I've installed bigrquery and dplyr from CRAN and from the github repos. You can reproduce my setup by uncommenting the devtools:: lines at the top.

Moved from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23668671/how-to-create-bigquery-tbl-using-dplyr to here.
